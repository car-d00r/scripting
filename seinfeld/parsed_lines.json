Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How \n              are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little \n              bit about our organization. \"Where ever women are?\", we \n              have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be \n              our best man, OK, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from \n              our staff is on the scene...That's why, I think, men get frustrated, \n              when we see women reading articles, like: \"Where to meet men?\". \n              We're here, we are everywhere. We're honking our horns to serve \n              you better.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n<Spell checked and reformatted by Mike \"The News Guy\">\n\n\n"
